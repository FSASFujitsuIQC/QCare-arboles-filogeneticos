# quantum-phylogenetic-trees

Reproduction of the paper 'Phylogenetic tree reconstruction via graph cut presented using a quantum-inspired computer' by Onodera et al. (2023). The method consists on using Fujitsu's Digital Annealer to break down the all-to-all graph of species with their similatiry matrix in order to reconstruct their phylogenetic tree.
